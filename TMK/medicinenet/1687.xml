<first>Priapism Penis Disorder
What is the
definitionof priapism? Priapism is a prolonged, unwanted erection of the penis. It is usually 
painful and not related to sexual stimulation or arousal.
 Most clinicians 
consider priapism a medical emergency because the condition can result in
 impotence , sexual dysfunction or penile infection. 
CAUSES:  A normal erection occurs in response to sexual stimulation. Priapism occurs in several conditions that interfere with the blood flow to the penis or blood drainage from the penis. This condition is unrelated to sexual stimulation and can last for several hours. Below are some of the causes of priapism. Medical conditions that can cause priapism: Sickle cell disease (most common reason for priapism) Leukemia History of
 malignancy (
 cancer ) Trauma as a cause of priapism: Direct trauma to the penis, pelvis, or perineum Spinal cord injuries Medications (several
 drugs have priapism as a side effect): Antidepressants Antipsychotics Blood thinners (
 warfarin [
 Coumadin ] and
 heparin ) Medications to help with
 erectile dysfunction Â (Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, Caverject) Illegal drugs ( cocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, crystal meth, cannabis)
 
SYMPTOMS:  Priapism results in a persistent erection. Priapism is usually divided into three categories. 
DIAGNOSIS:  The diagnosis of priapism is based on history (asking the patient questions) and the 
physical exam of the genitalia. Once a health care professional has finished this 
part of the exam a few other tests might be ordered. Measurement of blood gas: By inserting a small needle and removing blood from 
 the penis the doctor will be able to establish the oxygen content and therefore 
the type of priapism the patient has. Blood tests: Measuring white and
 red blood cells and platelets will help 
the health care professional determine why the patient might have a priapism. 
TREATMENT:  The treatment of ischemic priapism includes several modalities and will depend on how long the priapism has been present, and the results of the blood tests. These interventions are performed in a step wise fashion with surgery being the last resort. Unfortunately, some of the treatments of priapism can lead to
 erectile dysfunction in the future. Treatments for priapism are as follows: Aspiration: Blood is drained from the penis using a 16 or 18 gauge needle and syringe. Medication: A medication that constricts blood vessels that carry blood into the penis (Alpha Adrenergic Sympathomimetic; phenylephrine) is injected into the penis using a small (29 gauge) needle into the
 corpora cavernosa area of the penis. Surgery: A surgical procedure that reroutes blood can be performed. Ice to the area around the genitals is sometime utilized. In severe cases surgical procedures are available. Non-ischemic priapism is usually not an emergency and will frequently resolve without interventions.
 
COMPLCATIONS:  Ischemic priapism can cause significant complications. Due to the lack of oxygen, there can be significant damage if priapism lasts for more than four hours. The complications include
 erectile dysfunction as well as disfigurement of the penis. When to see a health care professional A painful erection lasting for more than 4 hours should trigger an emergency 
department visit. If the unwanted erection resolves in less than four hours a 
nonemergent doctor's visit should be scheduled. 
PREVENTION:  Priapism or recurrence of priapism can be prevented by treating the 
underlying medical cause that resulted in priapism or changing medications that 
have priapism as their side effects. No medications should be discontinued or 
changed until you speak with your healthcare provider.
