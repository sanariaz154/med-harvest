<first>Cleidocranial Dysplasia
What is cleidocranial dysplasia? Cleidocranial dysplasia is a condition that primarily affects the development 
of the bones and
 teeth . 
SYMPTOMS:  Signs and symptoms of cleidocranial dysplasia can vary 
widely in severity, even within the same family. Individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia usually have underdeveloped or 
absent collarbones (clavicles). As a result, their shoulders are narrow and 
sloping, can be brought unusually close together in front of the body, and in 
some cases the shoulders can be made to meet in the middle of the body. Delayed 
closing of the spaces between the bones of the skull (fontanels) is also 
characteristic of this condition. The fontanels usually close in early 
childhood, but may remain open into adulthood in people with this disorder. Affected individuals may be 3 to 6 inches shorter than other members of their 
family, and may have: short, tapered fingers and broad thumbs;
 short forearms;
 flat
 feet ;
 knock knees; and
 an abnormal curvature of 
the spine (
 scoliosis ). Characteristic facial features may include: Individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia may have 
decreased
 bone density (
 osteopenia ) and may 
develop
 osteoporosis , a condition that makes bones progressively more brittle 
and prone to fracture, at a relatively early age. 
Women with cleidocranial dysplasia have an increased risk of requiring a 
cesarean section when delivering a baby, due to a narrow pelvis preventing 
passage of the infant's head. Dental abnormalities seen in cleidocranial dysplasia may 
include: delayed loss of the primary (baby) teeth;
 delayed appearance of the 
secondary (adult) teeth;
 unusually shaped, peg-like teeth;
 misalignment of the 
teeth and jaws (malocclusion); and
 extra teeth, sometimes accompanied by
 cysts 
 in the gums. In addition to skeletal and dental abnormalities, people 
with cleidocranial dysplasia may have
 hearing loss and be prone to 
sinus and 
ear 
infections. Some young children with this condition are mildly delayed in the 
development of motor skills such as crawling and
 walking , but intelligence is unaffected.
 How common is cleidocranial dysplasia? Cleidocranial dysplasia occurs in approximately 1 per million individuals 
worldwide. What genes are related to cleidocranial dysplasia? The RUNX2 gene provides instructions for making a 
protein that is involved in bone and cartilage development and maintenance. This protein is a transcription 
factor, which means it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps 
control the activity of particular genes. Researchers believe that the RUNX2 
protein acts as a "master switch," regulating a number of other genes involved 
in the development of cells that build bones (osteoblasts). Some mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the RUNX2 
protein. Other mutations introduce a premature stop signal that results in an 
abnormally short protein. Occasionally, the entire gene is missing. These genetic changes reduce or eliminate the activity of the protein 
produced from one copy of the RUNX2 gene in each cell, decreasing the total 
amount of functional RUNX2 protein. This shortage of functional RUNX2 protein 
interferes with normal bone and cartilage development, resulting in the signs 
and symptoms of cleidocranial dysplasia. In rare cases, affected individuals may 
experience additional, unusual symptoms resulting from the loss of other genes 
near RUNX2. In about one-third of individuals with cleidocranial dysplasia, no mutation 
in the RUNX2 gene has been found. The cause of the condition in these 
individuals is unknown.
 How do people inherit cleidocranial dysplasia? This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one 
copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In 
some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. 
Other cases may result from new mutations in the gene. These cases occur in 
people with no history of the disorder in their family. Where can I find information about treatment for cleidocranial dysplasia? These resources address the management of cleidocranial dysplasia and may 
include treatment providers. Gene Review:
