<first>Male Menopause
Male Menopause Introduction Women may not be the only ones who suffer the effects of changing hormones. Some doctors are noticing that their male patients are reporting some of the same symptoms that women experience in
 perimenopause and
 menopause . The medical community is currently debating whether or not men really do go through a well-defined
 menopause . Doctors say that male patients receiving
 hormone therapy with testosterone have reported relief of some of the symptoms associated with so-called male
 menopause . What Is Male Menopause? Because men do not go through a well-defined period referred to as menopause, some doctors refer to this problem as
 androgen (testosterone) decline in the
 aging male, or what some people call
 low testosterone . Men do experience a decline in the production of the male hormone testosterone with
 aging , but this also occurs with conditions such as
 diabetes . Along with the decline in testosterone, some men experience symptoms that include
 fatigue ,
 weakness ,
 depression , and sexual problems. The relationship of these symptoms to decreased testosterone levels is still controversial. Unlike menopause in women, when hormone production stops completely, testosterone decline in men is a slower process. The testes, unlike the ovaries, do not run out of the substance it needs to make testosterone. A healthy male may be able to make sperm well into his eighties or longer. However, as a result of disease, subtle changes in the function of the testes may occur as early as 45 to 50 years of age, and more dramatically after the age of 70 in some men. How Is Male Menopause Diagnosed? To make the diagnosis of male menopause, the doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms. He or she may order other diagnostic tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the condition. The doctor will then order a series of blood tests, which may include measuring testosterone level. Can Male Menopause Be Treated? If testosterone levels are low, testosterone replacement therapy may help relieve such symptoms as loss of interest in sex (decreased libido),
 depression , and
 fatigue . But, as with
 hormone replacement therapy in women, testosterone replacement therapy has potential risks and side effects. Replacing testosterone may worsen
 prostate cancer , for example. If you or a loved one is considering androgen replacement therapy, talk to a doctor to learn more. Your doctor may also recommend certain lifestyle changes, such as a new
 diet or
 exercise program, or other medications, such as an
 antidepressant , to help with some of the symptoms of male menopause. WebMD Medical Reference</first>
