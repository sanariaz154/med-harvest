<first>Parry-Romberg Syndrome
What is and what causes Parry-Romberg syndrome? Parry-Romberg syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by slowly progressive 
deterioration (atrophy) of the skin and soft tissues of half of the face 
(hemifacial atrophy), usually the left side. It is more common in females than 
in males. What are the signs and symptoms of Parry-Romberg syndrome? Initial facial changes usually involve the tissues above the upper jaw 
(maxilla) or between the nose and the upper corner of the lip (nasolabial fold) 
and subsequently progress to the angle of the mouth, areas around the eye, the 
brow, the ear, and the neck. The deterioration may also affect the tongue, the 
soft and fleshy part of the roof of the mouth, and the gums. The eye and cheek 
of the affected side may become sunken and facial hair may turn white and fall 
out (
 alopecia ). In addition, the skin overlying affected areas may become darkly 
pigmented (
 hyperpigmentation ) with, in some cases, areas of hyperpigmentation 
and patches of unpigmented skin (
 vitiligo ). Parry-Romberg syndrome is also 
accompanied by neurological abnormalities including
 seizures and episodes of 
severe facial
 pain (
 trigeminal neuralgia ). At what age does Parry-Romberg syndrome occur? The onset of the disease usually 
begins between the ages of 5 and 15 years. The progression of the atrophy often 
lasts from 2 to 10 years, and then the process seems to enter a stable phase. 
Muscles in the face may atrophy and there may be bone loss in the facial bones. 
Problems with the
 retina and
 optic nerve may occur when the disease surrounds 
the eye.
 Is there any treatment for Parry-Romberg syndrome? There is no cure and there are no treatments that can stop the progression of 
Parry-Romberg syndrome. Reconstructive or microvascular surgery may be needed to 
repair wasted tissue. The timing of surgical intervention is generally agreed to 
be the best following exhaustion of the disease course and completion of facial 
growth. Most surgeons will recommend a waiting period of one or two years before 
proceeding with reconstruction. Muscle or bone grafts may also be helpful. Other 
treatment is symptomatic and supportive. What is the prognosis for Parry-Romberg syndrome? The prognosis for individuals with Parry-Romberg syndrome varies. In some 
cases, the atrophy ends before the entire face is affected. In mild cases, the 
disorder usually causes no disability other than cosmetic effects. What research is being done for Parry-Romberg syndrome? The NINDS supports research on neurological disorders such as Parry-Romberg 
syndrome with the goal of finding ways to prevent, treat, and cure them. NIH Patient Recruitment for Parry-Romberg
