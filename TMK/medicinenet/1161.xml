<first>Pain Management: Arachnoiditis
Symptoms Tingling, numbness, or
 weakness in the legs Sensations that may feel like insects crawling on the skin or water trickling down the leg Severe shooting pain that can be similar to an electric
 shock sensation Muscle cramps , spasms and uncontrollable twitching Bladder, bowel and/or sexual dysfunction As the disease progresses, symptoms may become more severe or even permanent. Many people with arachnoiditis are unable to work and suffer significant disability because they are in constant pain. Causes of Arachnoiditis Direct injury to the spine Chemicals: Dye used in myelograms (diagnostic tests in which a dye called radiographic contrast media is injected into the area surrounding the spinal cord and nerves) have been blamed for some cases of arachnoiditis. The radiographic contrast media responsible for this is no longer used, however. Also, there is concern that the preservatives found in epidural steroid injections may cause arachnoiditis. Infection from bacteria or viruses: Infections such as viral and
 fungal meningitis or
 tuberculosis can affect the spine. Chronic compression of spinal nerves: Causes for this compression include chronic
 degenerative disc disease or advanced spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal column). Complications from spinal surgery or other invasive spinal procedures: Similar causes include multiple
 lumbar (lower back) punctures.
 Making the Diagnosis Note: Myelograms with the radiographic contrast currently in use, combined with CAT scanning, are not considered to be responsible for causing arachnoiditis or causing it to worsen. Treating Arachnoiditis Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Neuroscience Center.
