<first>Health Tips for Healthy Living

ABOUT: This article is designed to give tips to readers about how they can improve or augment actions in their life to have a healthy lifestyle; it is not meant to be all inclusive but will include major components that are considered to be parts of a lifestyle that lead to good health. In addition to the tips about what people should do for healthy living, the article will mention some of the tips about avoiding actions (the don&amp;#39;ts) that lead to unhealthy living. "Healthy living" to most people means both physical and
 mental health are in balance or functioning well together in a person. In many instances, physical and mental health are closely linked, so that a change (good or bad) in one directly affects the other. Consequently, some of the tips will include suggestions for emotional and mental "healthy living." Eating (diet) All humans have to eat food for growth and maintenance of a healthy body, but we humans have different requirements as infants, children (kids), teenagers, young adults, adults, and seniors. For example, infants may require feeding every four hours until they gradually age and begin to take in more solid foods. Eventually they develop into the more normal pattern of eating three times per day as young kids. However, as most parents know, kids, teenagers, and young adults often snack between meals. Snacking is often not limited to these age groups because adults and seniors often do the same. Tips: Eat three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner); it is important to remember that dinner does not have to be the largest meal. The bulk of food consumption should consist of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk products. Choose lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts (with emphasis on beans and nuts). Choose foods that are low in saturated
 fats , trans fats,
 cholesterol , salt (sodium), and added sugars; look at the labels because the first listed items on the labels comprise the highest concentrations of ingredients. Control portion sizes; eat the smallest portion that can satisfy hunger and then stop eating. Snacks are OK in moderation and should consist of items like fruit, whole grains, or nuts to satisfy hunger and not cause excessive
 weight gain . Avoid sodas and
 sugar -enhanced
 drinks because of the excessive calories in the sodas and
 sugar drinks;
 diet drinks may not be a good choice as they make some people hungrier and increase food consumption. Avoid eating a large meal before sleeping to decrease gastroesophageal reflux and weight gain. If a person is angry or
 depressed , eating will not solve these situations and may make the underlying problems worse. Avoid rewarding children with sugary snacks; such a pattern may become a lifelong habit for people. Avoid heavy meals in the summer months, especially during hot days. A
 vegetarian lifestyle has been promoted for a healthy lifestyle and
 weight loss ; vegetarians should check with their physicians to be sure they are getting enough
 vitamins ,
 minerals , and iron in their food. Cooking foods (above 165 F) destroys most harmful bacteria and other pathogens; if you choose to eat uncooked foods like fruits or vegetables, they should be thoroughly washed with running treated (safe to drink) tap water right before eating. Avoid eating raw or undercooked meats of any type. Tips for special situations: People with
 diabetes should use the above tips and monitor their glucose levels as directed; try to keep the daily blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. People with unusual work schedules (night shifts, college students, military) should try to adhere to a breakfast, lunch, and dinner routine with minimal snacking. People who prepare food should avoid using grease or frying foods in grease. People trying to
 lose weight (body fat) should avoid all fatty and sugary foods and eat mainly vegetables, fruits, and nuts and markedly reduce his/her intake of meat and dairy products. Seek medical advice early if you cannot control your weight, food intake, or if you have
 diabetes and cannot control your blood glucose levels.
 Physical activity and exercise Physical activity and
 exercise is a major contributor to a healthy lifestyle; people are made to use their bodies, and disuse leads to unhealthy living. Unhealthy living may manifest itself in
 obesity ,
 weakness , lack of endurance, and overall poor health that may foster disease development. Tips: Regular
 exercise can prevent and reverse age-related decreases in muscle mass and strength, improve balance, flexibility, and endurance, and decrease the risk of falls in the elderly. Regular exercise can help prevent coronary
 heart disease ,
 stroke ,
 diabetes , obesity, and
 high blood pressure . Regular, weight-bearing exercise can also help prevent
 osteoporosis by building bone strength. Regular exercise can help chronic
 arthritis sufferers improve their capacity to perform daily activities such as driving, climbing stairs, and opening jars. Regular exercise can help increase self-esteem and self-confidence, decrease
 stress and
 anxiety , enhance mood, and improve general mental health. Regular exercise can help control weight gain and in some people cause loss of fat. Thirty minutes of modest exercise (
 walking is OK) at least three to five days a week is recommended, but the greatest health benefits come from exercising most days of the week. Exercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions. Start slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury or excessive soreness or
 fatigue . Over time, build up to 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. People are never too old to start exercising. Even frail, elderly individuals (70-90 years of age) can improve their strength and balance with exercise. Almost any type of exercise (resistance, water aerobics, walking,
 swimming , weights,
 yoga , and many others) is helpful for everybody. Children need exercise; play outside of the home is a good beginning. Sports for children may provide excellent opportunities for exercise, but care must be taken not to overdo certain exercises (for example, throwing too many pitches in baseball may harm a joint like the elbow or shoulder). Exertion during strenuous exercise may make a person tired and sore, but if
 pain occurs, stop the exercise until the
 pain source is discovered; the person may need to seek medical help and advice about continuation of such exercise. Most individuals can begin moderate exercise, such as walking, without a medical examination. The following people, however, should consult a doctor before beginning more vigorous exercise: Men over age 40 or women over age 50 Individuals with heart or lung disease,
 asthma , arthritis, or
 osteoporosis Individuals who experience chest pressure or pain with exertion, or who develop
 fatigue or
 shortness of breath easily Individuals with conditions that increase their risks of developing coronary
 heart disease , such as
 high blood pressure , diabetes,
 cigarette smoking , high blood cholesterol, or having family members who had early onset
 heart attacks and coronary
 heart disease Individuals who are morbidly
 obese Consequences of physical inactivity and lack of exercise: Physical inactivity and lack of exercise are associated with heart disease and some
 cancers . Physical inactivity and lack of exercise are associated with type II
 diabetes mellitus (also known as maturity or adult-onset,
 non-insulin-dependent diabetes ). Physical inactivity and lack of exercise contribute to weight gain. Healthy living involves more than physical health, it also includes emotional or mental health. The following are some ways people can support their mental health and well-being. Tips: Get enough
 sleep daily; the CDC recommends the following by age group (naps inclusive); 12-18 hours from birth to 2 months, 14-15 hours from 3-11 months of age, 12-18 hours for 1-3 years of age, 11-13 hours for 3-5 years of age, 10-11 hours for 5-10 years of age, eight and a half to nine and a half hours for 10-17 years of age and those 18 and above need seven to nine hours of
 sleep . Elderly people need about seven to nine hours but do not sleep as deeply and may awaken at night or wake early, so naps (like kids need) allow them to accumulate the total of seven to nine hours of sleep. Take a walk and reflect on what you see and hear at least several times per week. Try something new and often (eat a new food, try a different route to work, go to a new museum display). Do some mind exercises (read, do a puzzle occasionally during the week). Try to focus on a process intensely and complete a segment of it over one to several hours, then take a break and do something relaxing (walk, exercise, short nap). Plan to spend some time talking with other people about different subjects. Try to make some leisure time to do some things that interest you every week (hobby, sport). Learn ways to say "no" when something occurs that you do not want to do or be involved with. Have fun (go on a trip with someone you love, go shopping, go fishing; do not let vacation time slip away). Let yourself be pleased with your achievements, both big and small (develop contentment). Have a network of friends; those with strong social support systems lead healthier lives. Seek help and advice early if you feel depressed, have
 suicidal thoughts , or consider harming yourself or others. People taking medicine for mental-health problems should not stop taking these medications, no matter how "well" they feel, until they have discussed their situation with their prescribing doctor(s). Avoidance behavior is another key to healthy living. Below are described some of the major items to avoid if a person is seeking a healthy lifestyle.
 Avoid tobacco use Tobacco use is the most important preventable illness and cause of death in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Tobacco use was estimated to be the cause of 443,000 deaths in 2010 in the U.S. Tip: Stop
 smoking tobacco; start to stop today (it takes about 15 years of nonsmoking behavior to achieve a "normal" risk level for heart disease for those that smoke). Stop using
 chewing tobacco to avoid
 oral cancers . Tobacco use causes or contributes to a large number of cancers in the U.S. In men, 90% of
 lung cancer deaths are attributable to
 smoking ; 80% in women. Tobacco use causes cancers of the lung, mouth, lip, tongue,
 esophagus ,kidney, and bladder. It also further increases the risk of
 bladder cancer in subjects occupationally exposed to certain organic chemicals found in the textile, leather, rubber, dye, paint, and other organic chemical industries, and further increases the risk of
 lung cancer among subjects exposed to
 asbestos . Tobacco use causes
 atherosclerotic arterial disease (hardening and narrowing of the arteries) that can lead to
 heart attacks ,
 strokes , and lack of blood flow to the lower extremities. Tobacco use causes an estimated 20%-30% of coronary heart disease in the U.S. It also further increases the risk of
 heart attacks among subjects with elevated cholesterol, uncontrolled
 hypertension , obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Tobacco use causes an estimated 20% of chronic lung diseases in the U.S., such as
 chronic bronchitis and
 emphysema , and causes
 pneumonia in those with chronic lung disease. The CDC, in 2011, estimated that 90% of deaths from
 chronic obstructive lung disease (
 COPD ) were due to
 smoking . Pregnant women who smoke are more likely to deliver
 babies with low birth weight. Secondhand smoke can cause middle-
 ear infections (
 otitis media ),
 coughing ,
 wheezing ,
 bronchitis , and
 pneumonia in babies, and aggravate
 asthma in children .
 Secondhand smoke (sometimes referred to as
 passive smoking ) can also cause lung cancer. Quitting smoking is difficult to accomplish; tobacco contains
 nicotine , which is addictive. Some
 smokers can quit "cold turkey," but for most, quitting smoking requires a serious life-long commitment and an average of six quitting attempts before success. Quitting smoking efforts may include behavior modification, counseling, use of nicotine chewing gum (
 Nicorette Gum ), nicotine skin patches (Transderm Nicotine), or oral medications such as
 bupropion (
 Zyban ).
 Avoid excessive alcohol consumption Chronic, excess alcohol consumption is the major cause of
 liver cirrhosis in the U.S. Liver cirrhosis can cause internal hemorrhage, fluid accumulation in the abdomen, easy bleeding and
 bruising , muscle wasting, mental
 confusion , infections, and in advanced cases,
 coma , and
 kidney failure . Liver cirrhosis can lead to
 liver cancer . Alcohol accounts for 40%-50% of deaths from automobile accidents in the U.S. Alcohol use is a significant cause of injury and death from home accidents,
 drowning , and
 burns . There are many treatments for
 alcoholism . But the crucial first step to recovery is for the individual to admit there is a problem and make a commitment to address the alcoholism issue. The 12-step-style self-help programs, pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous, can be one effective treatment. Psychologists and related professionals have developed programs to help individuals better handle emotional stresses and avoid behaviors that can lead to excess drinking. Support and understanding from family members are often critical for sustained recovery. Medication can be useful for the prevention of relapses and for withdrawal symptoms following acute or prolonged intoxication.
 Avoid high-risk sexual behaviors High-risk sexual behavior can lead to the acquisition of sexually transmitted illnesses such as
 gonorrhea ,
 syphilis ,
 herpes , or
 HIV infection. High-risk sexual behavior is also known to spread
 human papillomavirus infection, which can lead to
 cervical cancer in women and other anogenital cancers in both men and women. High-risk sexual behaviors include the following: Multiple sex partners Sex partners with a history of the following:
 Intravenous
 drug use Venereal disease (
 sexually transmitted diseases or
 STDs ) Transmission of
 HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (
 chlamydia ,
 gonorrhea ,
 syphilis ,
 genital herpes ) Transmission of
 hepatitis B (50% of
 hepatitis B infections are due to sexual transmission) and, in rare instances,
 hepatitis C Transmission of human papilloma virus (
 HPV ), which can cause
 genital warts and anogenital carcinomas, most commonly
 cancer of the uterine cervix Unplanned
 pregnancy Avoid unprotected sex (sex without barriers such as a
 condom ) outside an established, committed, monogamous relationship. If you plan to have sex and are unsure of your partner&amp;#39;s health status, use a condom.
 Avoid other high-risk behaviors Driving under the influence of alcohol or
 drugs Driving while sleep-deprived Reckless driving and speeding, "road rage" Driving while using cell phones, texting, or performing other tasks Motorcycle (and bicycle) riding without helmets Possession of firearms and guns without proper training and storage Smoking in bed Motor vehicle accidents account for 40%-50% of accidental deaths. Motorcycle accidents are a major cause of serious head injuries. Firearms and guns account for a significant proportion of deaths among adolescents due to male
 suicide and homicide. Smoking in bed can lead to burn injury and death. When driving, use seat restraints on all passengers, both front and rear seats. Do not drink and drive. Do not drive if sleep deprived. Avoid unnecessary distractions and focus on the road and traffic while driving (avoid texting, talking on cell phones, eating, applying
 makeup , or other distractions). Use helmets while riding bicycles and motorcycles. Helmet use reduces deaths from motorcycle accidents by 30% and serious head injuries by 75%. Obtain proper training in the use and storage of guns and ammunition. Use smoke detectors; avoid smoking in bed. Melanoma and other
 skin cancers Avoid sunburns and sun exposure by using adequate skin protection; use brimmed hats, protective clothing, and
 sunscreen . Sunscreens have undergone changes, and the U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) published new requirements that sunscreens needed to meet starting in 2012. Currently, the FDA suggests an effective sunscreen is rated as
 SPF 30 or higher and has both UVA and UVB protection (protection against ultraviolet waves of types A and B). In most instances, sunscreen needs to be applied every two hours and each time after a person has gone swimming.
 Additional tips for healthy living Although there are many other risky behaviors that may impede an otherwise healthy lifestyle (for example, working with toxic or radioactive materials,
 drug addiction , travel to areas with unusual endemic diseases), these are too numerous to cover in this general article. However, the reader is advised to visit such topic sites on MedicineNet.com, eMedicineHealth.com or WebMD.com because most of the specific articles will provide tips to avoid health-related problems.
