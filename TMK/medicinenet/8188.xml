Malignant hyperthermia facts* *
 
ABOUT: medical author: Melissa Conrad St√∂ppler, MD Malignant hyperthermia is a severe reaction to particular
 drugs that are often used during general anesthesia for surgery. Malignant hyperthermia occurs in 1 in 5,000 to 50,000 instances in which people are given anesthetic gases. Muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (
 rhabdomyolysis ), a high
 fever , increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate are some of the effects of this potentially life-threatening condition. Researchers have described at least six forms of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, which are caused by mutations in different genes. For example, variations of the CACNA1S and RYR1 genes increase the risk of developing malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of the condition). What is malignant hyperthermia? Malignant hyperthermia is a severe reaction to particular drugs that are 
often used during surgery and other invasive procedures. Specifically, this 
reaction occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block 
the sensation of
 pain , and with a muscle relaxant that is used to temporarily 
paralyze a person during a surgical procedure. If given these drugs, people at 
risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of 
muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high
 fever , increased acid levels in the blood 
and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate. Without prompt treatment, 
the complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening. People at increased risk for this disorder are said to have malignant 
hyperthermia susceptibility. Affected individuals may never know they have the 
condition unless they undergo testing or have a severe reaction to anesthesia 
during a surgical procedure. While this condition often occurs in people without 
other serious medical problems, certain inherited muscle diseases (including 
 central core disease and multiminicore disease) are associated with malignant 
hyperthermia susceptibility.
 How common is malignant hyperthermia? Malignant hyperthermia occurs in 1 in 5,000 to 50,000 instances in which 
people are given anesthetic gases. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is 
probably more frequent, because many people with an increased risk of this 
condition are never exposed to drugs that trigger a reaction. What genes are related to malignant hyperthermia? Variations of the
 CACNA1S and
 RYR1 genes increase the risk of developing 
malignant hyperthermia. Researchers have described at least six forms of malignant hyperthermia 
susceptibility, which are caused by mutations in different genes. Mutations in 
the
 RYR1 gene are responsible for a form of the condition known as MHS1. These 
mutations account for most cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. 
Another form of the condition,
 MHS5 , results from mutations in the
 CACNA1S gene. 
These mutations are less common, causing less than 1 percent of all cases of 
malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The
 RYR1 and
 CACNA1S genes provide instructions for making proteins that play 
essential roles in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to 
move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated 
way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain charged atoms 
(ions) into muscle cells. The proteins produced from the
 RYR1 and
 CACNA1S genes 
are involved in the movement of calcium ions within muscle cells. In response to 
certain signals, the
 CACNA1S protein helps activate the RYR1 channel, which 
releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells. The resulting increase in 
calcium ion
 concentration inside muscle cells stimulates muscle fibers to 
contract. Mutations in the
 RYR1 or
 CACNA1S gene cause the
 RYR1 channel to open more 
easily and close more slowly in response to certain drugs. As a result, large 
amounts of calcium ions are released from storage within muscle cells. An 
overabundance of available calcium ions causes skeletal muscles to contract 
abnormally, which leads to muscle rigidity in people with malignant 
hyperthermia. An increase in calcium ion concentration within muscle cells also 
activates processes that generate heat (leading to increased body temperature) 
and produce excess acid (leading to acidosis). The genetic causes of several other types of malignant hyperthermia (MHS2, 
MHS4, and MHS6) are still under study. A form of the condition known as MHS3 has 
been linked to the
 CACNA2D1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a 
protein that plays an essential role in activating the RYR1 channel to release 
calcium ions into muscle cells. Although this gene is thought to be related to 
malignant hyperthermia in a few families, no causative mutations have been 
identified.
 How do people inherit malignant hyperthermia? Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant 
pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to 
increase the risk of a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery. In 
most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from a parent who is 
also at risk for the condition. Where can I find information about diagnosis,
