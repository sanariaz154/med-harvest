<first>POTS (POT Syndrome, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome)
POT syndrome definition and facts* POTS is a condition characterized by too little blood returning to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing up position. Symptoms can include
 fainting ,
 dizziness , or
 lightheadedness when standing up from a reclining position. The reduced blood flow to the heart causes the heart rate to increase (tachycardia). About 70%-80% of people affected by POTS are women between the ages of 15 and 50. The cause of POTS is poorly understood. Symptoms often begin after major surgery,
 trauma , or a viral illness. Some women may develop the condition after
 pregnancy , or the symptoms may worsen before the
 menstrual period . Treatment involves relieving low blood volume or regulating any circulatory problems. There is not one single treatment that has been found to be effective for all patients. Sometimes, changes like adding extra salt to the
 diet and maintaining adequate fluid intake are often effective for symptom relief. What is postural tachycardia syndrome? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is one of a group of disorders that have orthostatic intolerance (OI) as their primary symptom. OI describes a condition in which an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after an individual stands up from a lying down position. Who gets POT syndrome? Anyone at any age can develop POTS, but the majority of individuals affected (between 75 and 80 percent) are women between the ages of 15 to 50 years of age. Some women report an increase in episodes of POTS right before their menstrual periods. POTS often begins after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness. It may make individuals unable to
 exercise because the activity brings on
 fainting spells or
 dizziness . 
CAUSES:  Doctors aren&amp;#39;t sure yet what causes the reduced return of blood to the heart that occurs in OI, or why the heart begins to beat so rapidly in POTS. Current thinking is that there are a number of mechanisms. Some patients have peripheral denervation (neuropathic POTS); some have symptoms that are due to sustained or parosyxmal overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (hyperadrenergic POTS); and some individuals have PTOS dominated by features of deconditioning. 
SYMPTOMS:  The primary symptom of OI is lightheadedness or fainting. In POTS, the lightheadedness or fainting is also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat of more than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate that exceeds 120 beats per minute, within 10 minutes of rising. The faintness or lightheadedness of POTS are relieved by lying down again.
 What treatments, therapies, diets, and excercises can help the symptoms of POT syndrome? Therapies for POTS are targeted at relieving low blood volume or regulating circulatory problems that could be causing the disorder. No single treatment has been found to be effect for all. A number of
 drugs seem to be effective in the short term. Whether they help in long term is uncertain. Simple interventions such as adding extra salt to the
 diet and attention to adequate fluid intake are often effective. The drugs
 fludrocortisone (for those on a high salt diet) and
 midodrine in low doses are often used to increase blood volume and narrow blood vessels. Drinking 16 ounces of water (2 glassfuls) before getting up can also help raise
 blood pressure . Some individuals are helped by beta receptor blocking agents. There is some evidence that an
 exercise program can gradually improve orthostatic tolerance. What is the prognosis? POTS may follow a relapsing-remitting course, in which symptoms come and go, for years. In most cases (approximately 80 percent), an individual with POTS improves and becomes functional, although some residual symptoms are common. What research is being done? The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
 Stroke (NINDS) and other Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research related to POTS in their laboratories at the NIH and support additional research through grants to major research institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as POTS.
