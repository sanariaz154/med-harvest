Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome facts* *Hutchinson-
ABOUT: medical author:  Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the dramatic and rapid appearance of
 aging ; symptoms begin in early childhood. Signs and symptoms may include facial changes such as thin, beaked-tipped nose, a small chin, thin lips, protruding ears and prominent eyes; other non-facial features may include joint abnormalities, loss of fat under the skin,
 hair loss , and aged-looking skin but the child's intellect and motor skills are usually not altered. Progeria syndrome is very rare; only about 130 individuals have been diagnosed since 1886. Mutations in the
 LMNA gene cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome due to production of an abnormal lamin A protein. People inherit the disease; only one copy of the
 LMNA gene is enough to cause the disease because it is an autosomal dominant gene. Complications of progeria syndrome include severe
 hardening of the arteries beginning in childhood that markedly increase the chance of a
 heart attack or
 stroke at an early age (average life-span is about 13 years). Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome has several names in the literature (progeria, progeria of childhood, HGPS, and progeria syndrome); parents and others are urged to consult with a specialist in genetic diseases for additional information about diagnosis and treatments.
 What is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome? Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by 
the dramatic, rapid appearance of
 aging beginning in childhood. Affected 
children typically look normal at birth and in early infancy, but then grow more 
slowly than other children and do not gain weight at the expected rate (failure 
to thrive). What are the characteristics, signs, and symptoms of Hutchinson-Gilford 
progeria syndrome? They develop a characteristic facial appearance including: prominent 
eyes, a thin nose with a beaked tip, thin lips, a small chin, and protruding 
ears. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome also causes: hair loss (
 alopecia ), aged-looking skin, joint abnormalities, and a loss of fat under the skin 
(subcutaneous fat). This condition does not disrupt intellectual development or 
the development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and
 walking . How common is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome? This condition is very rare; it is reported to occur in 1 in 4 million 
newborns worldwide. More than 130 cases have been reported in the scientific 
literature since the condition was first described in 1886.
 What genes are related to Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome? Mutations in the
 LMNA gene cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. The
 LMNA gene provides instructions for making a protein called lamin A. This 
protein plays an important role in determining the shape of the nucleus within 
cells. It is an essential scaffolding (supporting) component of the nuclear 
envelope, which is the membrane that surrounds the nucleus. Mutations that cause 
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome result in the production of an abnormal 
version of the lamin A protein. The altered protein makes the nuclear envelope 
unstable and progressively damages the nucleus, making cells more likely to die 
prematurely. Researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the 
characteristic features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. How do people inherit Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome? Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is considered an autosomal dominant 
condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient 
to cause the disorder. The condition results from new mutations in the
 LMNA gene, and almost always occurs in people with no history of the disorder in 
their family. What are the complications and prognosis of people with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome? Experience severe hardening 
of the arteries (
 arteriosclerosis ) beginning in childhood. This condition 
greatly increases the chances having a
 stroke at a young age. 
These serious complications can worsen over time and are life-threatening for 
affected individuals.
