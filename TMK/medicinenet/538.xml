<first>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)
What is an electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG)? The electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a noninvasive test that is used to
reflect underlying heart conditions by measuring the electrical activity of the
heart. By positioning leads (electrical sensing devices) on the body in
standardized locations, information about many heart conditions can be learned
by looking for characteristic patterns on the EKG. How is an ECG (EKG) performed? EKG leads are attached to the body while the patient lies flat on a bed or
table. Leads are attached to each extremity (four total) and to six pre-defined
positions on the front of the chest. A small amount of gel is applied to the
skin, which allows the electrical impulses of the heart to be more easily
transmitted to the EKG leads. The leads are attached by small suction cups,
Velcro straps, or by small adhesive patches attached loosely to the skin. The
test takes about five minutes and is painless. In some instances, men may require
the shaving of a small amount of chest hair to obtain optimal contact between
the leads and the skin. What is measured or can be detected on the ECG 
(EKG)? When is an ECG (EKG) performed? What conditions may be diagnosed with an ECG 
(EKG)? What are the limitations of the ECG (EKG)?</first>
