<first>Reflux Laryngitis Diet, Causes Home Remedies, and Treatment Medicine

ABOUT: Reflux
 laryngitis is inflammation of the voice box (larynx) caused by stomach acid backing up into the
 esophagus (acid reflux,
 gastroesophageal reflux disease ,
 GERD ). Heartburn is the most common symptom of reflux
 laryngitis . Acid reflux can irritate and inflame the lining of the esophagus and cause signs and symptoms that may include:
 Chronic
 hoarseness Problems swallowing Constantly clearing the throat Cough Asthma The feeling of a foreign body stuck in the throat Sinusitis Vocal cord spasms Erosive
 esophagitis Esophageal strictures Granulomas (growths on the vocal cords). Other causes of reflux laryngitis include
 obesity , tight clothing, or
 hiatal hernia . Medical treatments for reflux esophagitis include medications (acid blockers or
 proton pump inhibitors ), or surgery. Behavioral modifications such as
 weight loss , quitting
 smoking , sleeping with the head of the bed elevated, and dietary changes can decrease symptoms of reflux laryngitis. Rarely, reflux laryngitis may be a risk factor for developing esophageal
 cancers .
 
CAUSES:  Can it affect the vocal cords or cause cancer? Reflux is caused by
 weakness in the muscle at the junction of the esophagus with the stomach. Normally, this muscular valve, or sphincter, functions to keep food and stomach acid from moving upward from the stomach to the esophagus and larynx. This valve opens to allow food into the stomach and closes to keep the stomach&amp;#39;s contents from coming back up. The backward movement of stomach contents (gastric contents) up into the esophagus is called gastroesophageal reflux. Moreover, any increase in abdominal pressure (such as obesity or tight clothing, which can push acid back from the stomach up the esophagus) or a person with a hiatal
 hernia will have an increased risk for reflux. When it causes symptoms or esophageal inflammation it is referred to as
 gastroesophageal reflux disease (or
 GERD ). When the acid backs up into the voice box (larynx), the condition is referred to as reflux laryngitis. Stomach acid can cause irritation of the lining of the esophagus, larynx, and throat. This can lead to erosion of the lining of the esophagus (erosive esophagitis), narrowing of the esophagus (stricture), chronic
 hoarseness , chronic throat clearing, discomfort swallowing food, foreign body sensation in the throat, asthma or
 cough , spasms of the vocal cords, sinusitis , and growths on the vocal cords (granulomas). Rarely, reflux can lead to cancers of the esophagus or larynx.
 
SYMPTOMS:  Heartburn is the most common symptom associated with reflux. The American College of Gastroenterology estimates that more than 60 million Americans experience heartburn at least once a month and some studies suggest that more than 15 million people experience heartburn symptoms each day. The incidence of GERD is on the rise, and the rise in obesity is believed to be a contributing factor. In addition to heartburn, reflux severe enough to cause laryngitis can cause chronic hoarseness,
 asthma , or a foreign body sensation in the throat (globus phenomenon). Considering the high prevalence of GERD, reflux laryngitis and its symptoms are uncommon. 
DIAGNOSIS:  In most patients, the presumptive diagnosis of reflux laryngitis is based on the typical history of heartburn and hoarseness. Testing usually is reserved for those patients who do not respond to conservative therapy (as explained below) or drug therapy. Diagnostic tests includes an: esophagram (and X-ray of the esophagus) endoscopy , laryngoscopy, esophageal pH acid monitoring, and esophageal motility studies. 8 Reflux laryngitis diet tips and home remedies Diet , home remedies, medications, and lifestyle changes to treat acid reflux, heartburn, and reflux laryngitis. What OTC, prescription
medications, and surgery to treat acid reflux? There are several different types of medications available over the counter (OTC) or by prescription. Antacids neutralize stomach acid and give immediate relief. Popular choices include
 sodium bicarbonate (Alka Seltzer),
 calcium carbonate (
 Tums , Rolaids, Alka-Mints), and aluminum and magnesium antacids (
 Maalox ,
 Mylanta ,
 Riopan , Gaviscon). Use antacids 30 to 60 minutes after each meal and at bedtime because they are more effective at these times. People on a low sodium diet should avoid sodium bicarbonate. Calcium and aluminum can cause
 constipation , while magnesium antacids can cause
 diarrhea . Patents with
 kidney disease should avoid magnesium and aluminum antacids. Check with your pharmacist or doctor for any interactions with other medications you are taking.
 Drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), theophylline (Theo-Dur, Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24, Theolair, Uniphyl, Slo-Phyllin), anticholinergics, and calcium channel blockers should be avoided if feasible, but discuss discontinuing any medication with a doctor first. The acid-blocking drugs (famotidine [Pepcid], cimetidine [Tagamet], nizatidine [Axid], ranitidine [Zantac]) are known as H2-blockers. These are available without a prescription. However, their strength may be inadequate. Other valuable medications include metoclopramide (Reglan), which helps to empty the stomach more rapidly; or proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and lansoprazole (Prevacid). If conservative therapy and medical therapy fail, surgery may be necessary. Traditionally, fundoplication, a procedure that serves to strengthen or recreate the muscular valve (lower esophageal sphincter), requires significant surgical work and hospital stay. Surgery or fundoplication also has been able to be done with an endoscope, which shortens the hospital stay and recovery.
 
DIAGNOSIS:  In some patients it appears clear that the laryngeal symptoms - hoarseness, cough,
 sore throat - are due to reflux, for example, in patients with marked heartburn and regurgitation of acid. In most patients with laryngeal symptoms - those with milder heartburn and no regurgitation who comprise the majority of patients in whom reflux laryngitis is considered - it is not as clear. Examination of the larynx may reveal redness and swelling, but many diseases of the larynx as well as reflux can cause these signs. There are difficulties with using symptoms to diagnose reflux. For example, cough may occur when there is reflux into the esophagus. Refluxed liquid does not need to reach the larynx. Finally, it is unclear whether refluxed liquid from the stomach that is not acid can cause reflux laryngitis, and there is no way of testing whether or not non-acid liquid is reaching the larynx. Many physicians use a trial of potent acid-suppression with
 PPIs to try to prove that acid reflux is the cause of the laryngeal symptoms. The problem with a trial of PPIs is that some symptoms such as cough and throat clearing can be caused by habit, and the PPIs may have a placebo effect. Thus, a response to PPIs may not be proof that reflux is the cause of symptoms.
