Menstruation and Menopause The
 menstrual cycle is the process by which a woman's body gets ready for the 
chance of a
 pregnancy each month. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days from 
the start of one to the start of the next, but it can range from 21 days to 35 
days. Most menstrual periods last from three to five days. In the United States, 
most girls start menstruating at age 12, but girls can start menstruating 
between the ages of 8 and 16. Menopause is the absence 
of menstrual periods for 12 months. The menopausal transition begins with 
varying menstrual cycle lengths and ends with the final
 menstruation . Pregnancy and preconception care Pregnancy is the term used to describe when a woman has a growing fetus 
inside of her. In most cases, the fetus grows in the uterus. Human pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, or just more than 9 months, from the 
start of the
 last menstrual period to childbirth. What are prenatal and preconception care and why are they important? Prenatal care is the care woman gets during a pregnancy. Getting early and 
regular
 prenatal care is important for the health of both mother and the 
developing baby. In addition, health care providers are now recommending 
a woman see a health care provider for preconception care, even before she 
considers
 becoming pregnant or in between pregnancies. Both preconception care and prenatal care help to promote the best health 
outcomes for mother and baby.
 Fertility and Infertility Infertility is the term health care providers use for women who are unable to 
get
 pregnant , and for men who are unable to impregnate a woman, after at least 
one year of trying. In women, the term is used to describe those who are of 
normal childbearing age, not those who can't get pregnant because they are near 
or past
 menopause . Women who are able to get pregnant but who cannot carry a 
pregnancy to term (birth) may also be considered
 infertile . Infertility is a complex problem â€“ it does not have a single cause because
 getting pregnant is a multi-step chain of events. The cause of infertility can 
rest in the women or the man, or can be from unknown factors or a combination of 
factors. Contraception Contraception , also known as
 birth control , is designed to prevent pregnancy. 
Some types of
 birth control include (but are not limited to): Barrier methods , such as
 condoms , the
 diaphragm , and 
the
 cervical cap , are designed to prevent the sperm from reaching the egg for
 fertilization .
 Intrauterine device , or
 IUD , is a small device that is inserted into the 
uterus by a health care provider. The IUD prevents a fertilized egg from 
implanting in the uterus. An IUD can stay in the uterus for up to 10 years until 
it is removed by a health care provider.
 Hormonal birth control , such as
 birth control pills , injections, skin 
patches, and vaginal rings, release hormones into a woman's body that interfere 
with
 fertility by preventing
 ovulation , fertilization, or 
 implantation.
 Sterilization is a method that permanently prevents a woman from getting 
pregnant or a man from being able to get a woman pregnant. Sterilization 
involves surgical procedures that must be done by a health care provider and 
usually cannot be reversed. The choice of birth control depends on factors such as a person's overall 
health, age, frequency of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, desire to 
have children in the future, and family history of certain diseases. A woman 
should talk to her health care provider about her choice of birth control 
method.
 Sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS/HIV It is important to remember that even though
 birth control methods can 
prevent pregnancy, they do not all protect against
 sexually transmitted diseases or
 HIV . SOURCE: National Institute of Child and Health and Human Development;
