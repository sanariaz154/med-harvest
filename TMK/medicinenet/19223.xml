<first>Stroke Prevention
Introduction If you're like most Americans, you plan for your future. When you take a job, 
you examine its benefit plan. When you buy a home, you consider its location and 
condition so that your investment is safe. Today, more and more Americans are 
protecting their most important asset--their health. Are you? Stroke ranks as the third leading killer in the United 
States. A
 stroke can be devastating to individuals and their families, robbing 
them of their independence. It is the most common cause of adult disability. 
Each year more than 700,000 Americans have a
 stroke , with about 160,000 dying 
from stroke-related causes. Officials at the National Institute of Neurological 
Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) are committed to reducing that burden through 
biomedical research.
 What is a Stroke? A stroke, or "brain attack," occurs when blood circulation 
to the brain fails. Brain cells can die from decreased blood flow and the 
resulting lack of oxygen. There are two broad categories of stroke: Blockage of Blood Flow While not usually 
fatal, a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain or neck, called an ischemic stroke, is the most 
frequent cause of stroke and is responsible for about 80 percent of strokes. 
These blockages stem from three conditions: the formation of a clot within a 
blood vessel of the brain or neck, called
 thrombosis;
 the 
movement of a clot from another part of the body such as the heart to the neck or brain, called
 embolism ; or
 a severe narrowing of an artery in or leading to the brain, called 
 stenosis. Bleeding Bleeding into 
the brain or the spaces surrounding the brain causes the second type of stroke, 
called hemorrhagic stroke. Two key steps you can take will lower your risk of death or disability from 
stroke: know stroke's warning signs and control stroke's risk factors. 
Scientific research conducted by the NINDS has identified warning signs and a 
large number of risk factors.
 What are Warning Signs of a Stroke? Warning signs are clues your body sends that your brain is not receiving 
enough oxygen.
 If you observe one or more of these signs of a stroke or "brain 
attack," don't wait, call a doctor or 911 right away! Sudden numbness or
 weakness of face, arm or leg, especially on one side of 
the body
 Sudden
 confusion , trouble speaking or understanding
 Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
 Sudden trouble
 walking ,
 dizziness , loss of balance or coordination
 Sudden severe
 headache with no known cause Other danger signs that may occur include
 double vision , 
drowsiness, and
 nausea or
 vomiting . Sometimes the warning signs may last only a few moments and 
then disappear. These brief episodes, known as 
transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are sometimes called "mini-strokes." Although brief, they identify an 
underlying serious condition that isn't going away without medical help. 
Unfortunately, since they clear up, many people ignore them. Don't. Heeding them 
can save your life.
 What are Risk Factors for a Stroke? A risk factor is a condition or behavior that occurs more frequently in those 
who have, or are at greater risk of getting, a disease than in those who don't. 
Having a risk factor for stroke doesn't mean you'll have a stroke. On the other 
hand, not having a risk factor doesn't mean you'll avoid a stroke. But your risk 
of stroke grows as the number and severity of risk factors increases. Stroke occurs in all age groups, in both sexes, and in all races in every 
country. It can even occur before birth, when the fetus is still in the womb. In 
African-Americans, stroke is more common and more deadly--even in young and 
middle-aged adults--than for any ethnic or other racial group in the United 
States. Scientists have found more and more severe risk factors in some minority 
groups and continue to look for patterns of stroke in these groups.
 What Are the Treatable Risk Factors? Some of the most important treatable risk factors for stroke are: High blood pressure. Also called
 hypertension , this is 
by far the most potent risk factor for stroke. If your
 blood pressure is high, you and your 
doctor need to work out an individual strategy to bring it down to the normal 
range. Some ways that work: Maintain proper weight. Avoid
 drugs known to raise 
blood pressure. Cut down on salt. Eat fruits and vegetables to increase 
 potassium in your
 diet .
 Exercise more. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that help lower blood 
pressure. Controlling blood pressure will also help you avoid
 heart disease ,
 diabetes , and
 kidney failure .
 Cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoking has been linked to the buildup of 
fatty substances in the carotid artery, the 
main neck artery supplying blood to the brain. Blockage of this artery is the 
leading cause of stroke in Americans. Also,
 nicotine raises blood pressure; 
carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen your blood can carry to the brain; 
and cigarette smoke makes your blood thicker and more likely to clot. Your 
doctor can recommend programs and medications that may help you quit
 smoking . By 
quitting, at any age, you also reduce your risk of lung disease,
 heart disease , 
and a number of cancers including
 lung cancer .
 Heart disease. Common heart disorders such as coronary 
artery disease, valve defects, irregular heart beat, and enlargement of one of 
the heart's chambers can result in
 blood clots that may break loose and block vessels in or 
leading to the brain. The most common blood vessel disease, caused by the 
buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, is called
 atherosclerosis . Your 
doctor will treat your
 heart disease and may also prescribe medication, such as
 aspirin , to help 
prevent the formation of clots. Your doctor may recommend surgery to clean out a 
clogged neck artery if you match a particular risk profile. If you are over 50, 
NINDS scientists believe you and your doctor should make a decision about 
 aspirin therapy. A doctor can evaluate your risk factors 
and help you decide if you will benefit from aspirin or other blood-thinning 
therapy.
 Warning signs or history of stroke . If you experience a
 TIA , get help at 
once. Many communities encourage those with stroke's warning signs to dial 911 
for emergency medical assistance. If you have had a stroke in the past, it's 
important to reduce your risk of a second stroke. Your brain helps you recover 
from a stroke by drawing on body systems that now do double duty. That means a 
second stroke can be twice as bad.
 Diabetes . You may think this disorder affects only the 
body's ability to use
 sugar , or
 glucose . But it also causes destructive changes in the blood 
vessels throughout the body, including the brain. Also, if
 blood glucose levels 
are high at the time of a stroke, then
 brain damage is usually more severe and 
extensive than when blood glucose is well-controlled. Treating
 diabetes can 
delay the onset of complications that increase the risk of stroke.
 Do You Know Your Stroke Risk? Some of the most important risk factors for stroke can be determined during a 
physical exam at your doctor's office. If you are over 55 years old, the 
worksheet below can help you estimate your risk of stroke and show the benefit 
of risk-factor control. The worksheet was developed from NINDS-supported work in the well-known 
Framingham Study. Working with your doctor, you can develop a strategy to lower 
your risk to average or even below average for your age. Key: SBP = systolic blood pressure (score one line only, untreated or 
treated);
 Diabetes = history of
 diabetes ;
 Cigarettes = smokes cigarettes;
 CVD (
 cardiovascular disease ) = history of heart disease;
 AF = history of
 atrial fibrillation ;
 LVH = diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy Key: SBP = systolic blood pressure (score one line only, untreated or 
treated);

Risk Profile: The Framingham Study." Stroke, Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 40-43, January 
1994. Many risk factors for stroke can be managed, some very 
successfully. Although risk is never zero at any age, by starting early and 
controlling your risk factors you can lower your risk of death or disability 
from stroke. With good control, the risk of stroke in most age groups can be 
kept below that for accidental injury or death. Americans have shown that stroke is preventable and treatable. In recent 
years, a better understanding of the causes of stroke has helped Americans make 
lifestyle changes that have cut the stroke
 death rate nearly in half. Scientists at the NINDS predict that, with continued attention to reducing 
the risks of stroke and by using currently available therapies and developing 
new ones, Americans should be able to prevent 80 percent of all strokes. SOURCE: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; "Brain
