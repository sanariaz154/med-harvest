About type 1 diabetes

Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high.
The hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood.
There are two main types of diabetes:

Type 1 – where the pancreas doesn't produce any insulin
Type 2 – where the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body’s cells don't react to insulin
This topic is about type 1 diabetes.

type 2 diabetes
Another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth.
It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.
You should therefore visit your GP if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and feeling tired all the time (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms). 
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it's the most common type of childhood diabetes. This is why it's sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes. 
In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) doesn't produce any insulin – the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. This is why it's also sometimes called insulin-dependent diabetes.
If the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body's organs.
In type 2 diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. Around 90% of adults with diabetes have type 2, and it tends to develop later in life than type 1.
Diabetes symptoms
The symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose stays in the blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy.
Your body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine.
Typical symptoms include:

feeling very 
thirsty
passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few days or weeks). In adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few months).
Read more about the 
symptoms of type 1 diabetes
Causes of type 1 diabetes 
Type 1 diabetes occurs as a result of the body being unable to produce insulin, which moves glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy.
Without insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the bloodstream becomes acidic and you develop dangerous levels of
dehydration.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them.

causes of type 1 diabetes
Treating type 1 diabetes
It's important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible, so that treatment can be started.
Diabetes can't be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life.
If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.
As your body can't produce insulin, you'll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You'll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.
Insulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. Some last up to a whole day (long-acting), some last up to eight hours (short-acting) and some work quickly but don't last very long (rapid-acting). You'll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.
There are alternatives to insulin injections, but they're only suitable for a small number of patients. They are:

insulin pump therapy – where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a needle that's inserted under the skin
islet cell transplantation – where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes (read about the criteria for having an islet transplant)
a complete pancreas transplant

COMPLICATIONS: If diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. Large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.
Even a mildly raised glucose level that doesn't cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.

complications of type 1 diabetes
Living with diabetes
If you have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to look after your health very carefully. Caring for your health will also make treating your diabetes easier and minimise your risk of developing complications.
For example, eating a 
healthy, balanced dietand
exercising regularlywill lower your blood glucose level. 
Stopping smoking (if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developing
cardiovascular disease.
If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be 
invited to have their eyes screenedonce a year.

Symptoms of type 1 diabetes

The symptoms of type 1 diabetes can develop very quickly (over a few days or weeks), particularly in children.
In older adults, the symptoms can often take longer to develop (a few months).
However, they should disappear when you start taking insulin and you get the condition under control.
The main symptoms of 
diabetesare:

feeling very
thirsty
urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of
thrush(a yeast infection)
blurred vision caused by the lens of your eye changing shape
slow healing of cuts and grazes
Vomiting or heavy, deep breathing can also occur at a later stage. This is a dangerous sign and requires immediate admission to hospital for treatment.
When to seek urgent medical attention
You should seek urgent medical attention if you have diabetes and develop:

a loss of appetite
nausea or vomiting
a high temperature
stomach pain
fruity smelling breath – which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish (others will usually be able to smell it, but you won't)
Hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)
If you have diabetes, your blood glucose levels can become very low. This is known as 
hypoglycaemia(or a "hypo"), and it's triggered when injected insulin in your body moves too much glucose out of your bloodstream.
In most cases, hypoglycaemia occurs as a result of taking too much insulin, although it can also develop if you skip a meal, exercise very vigorously or drink
alcoholon an empty stomach.
Symptoms of a "hypo" include:

feeling shaky and irritable
sweating
tingling lips
feeling weak
feeling confused 
hunger
nausea (feeling sick)
A hypo can be brought under control simply by eating or drinking something sugary.
If it isn't brought under control, a hypo can cause confusion, slurred speech and, eventually, unconsciousness.
In this case, an emergency injection of a hormone called glucagon will be needed. Glucagon increases the glucose in your blood.
Hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose)
As diabetes occurs as a result of your body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. This happens because there's insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy.
If your blood glucose levels become too high, you may experience 
hyperglycaemia. The symptoms of hyperglycaemia are similar to the main symptoms of diabetes, but they may come on suddenly and be more severe. They include:

extreme thirst
a 
dry mouth
blurred vision
drowsiness
a need to pass urine frequently 
Left untreated, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a serious condition, where the body breaks down fat and muscle as an alternative source of energy. This leads to a build-up of acids in your blood, which can cause vomiting,
dehydration, unconsciousness and even death.
The 
Diabetes UKwebsite has more information about
diabetes symptoms.

Causes of type 1 diabetes

Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that's needed to control the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood.
When you eat, your digestive system breaks down food and passes its nutrients – including glucose – into your bloodstream.
The pancreas (a small gland behind your stomach) usually produces insulin, which transfers any glucose out of your blood and into your cells, where it's converted to energy.
However, if you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas is unable to produce any insulin (see below). This means that glucose can't be moved out of your bloodstream and into your cells.
Autoimmune condition
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Your immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them, destroying them completely or damaging them enough to stop them producing insulin.
It's not known exactly what triggers the immune system to do this, but some researchers have suggested that it may be due to a viral infection.
Type 1 diabetes is often inherited (runs in families), so the autoimmune reaction may also be genetic.
If you have a close relative – such as a parent, brother or sister – with type 1 diabetes, you have about a 6% chance of also developing the condition. The risk for people who don't have a close relative with type 1 diabetes is just under 0.5%.

Diagnosing type 1 diabetes

It's important to diagnose diabetes as early as possible, so that treatment can be started.
If you experience the
symptoms of diabetes, you should visit your GP as soon as possible. They'll ask about your symptoms and may request a urine and 
blood test.
Urine and blood tests
Your urine sample will be tested to see whether it contains glucose. Urine doesn't usually contain glucose, but if you have
diabetes, some glucose can overflow through the kidneys and into the urine. Your urine may also be tested for ketones (chemicals) that indicate type 1 diabetes.
If your urine contains glucose, a blood test can be used to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. A sample of your blood will be taken in the morning, before you've had anything to eat, and it will be tested to measure your blood glucose levels.
If your blood glucose levels aren't high enough for your GP to diagnose diabetes, you may need to have an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is also sometimes referred to as a glucose tolerance test (GTT).
After drinking a glucose drink, samples of your blood will be taken every half an hour, for two hours. The samples will be tested to find out how your body is dealing with the glucose.
Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
The glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test is another blood test that can be used to diagnose diabetes.
In people who've already been diagnosed with diabetes, the HbA1c test is often used to show how well their diabetes is being controlled.
The HbA1c test gives your average blood glucose level over the previous two to three months. The results can indicate whether the measures you're taking to control your diabetes are working.
Antibody tests
There are blood tests for specific antibodies that can identify type 1 diabetes.
If you've been diagnosed with diabetes, it's recommended that you have your HbA1c measured at least twice a year. However, you may need to have your HbA1c measured more frequently if:

you've recently been diagnosed with diabetes
your blood glucose remains too high
your treatment plan has been changed
Unlike other tests, such as the GTT, the HbA1c test can be carried out at any time of day and doesn't require any special preparation, such as fasting. However, it's less reliable in certain situations, such as during pregnancy.
The advantages associated with the HbA1c test make it the preferred method of assessing how well blood glucose levels are being controlled in a person with diabetes.
HbA1c is also increasingly being used as a diagnostic test for 
type 2 diabetes, and as a screening test for people at high risk of diabetes.

Treating type 1 diabetes

Monitoring blood glucose
An important part of your treatment is to make sure that your blood sugar level is as normal and stable as possible.
You'll be able to manage this using insulin treatment and by eating a
healthy, balanced diet, but you will also have to regularly check your blood glucose levels to make sure they're not too high or too low.
Exercise, illness, stress, drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, changes to your hormone levels during your monthly period can all affect your blood sugar levels.
In most cases, you'll need to check your blood glucose levels during the day, both at home and at work or school, using a simple finger prick blood test. You may need to do this up to four or more times a day, depending on the type of insulin treatment you're taking. Your diabetes care team will talk to you about your ideal blood glucose level.
The normal blood sugar level is 4.0-7.0 mmol/l before meals and less than 9.0 mmol/l two hours after meals. Mmol/l means millimoles per litre, and it's a way of defining the concentration of glucose in your blood.
The 
Diabetes UKwebsite has more information on 
testing your glucose levels.
Having your blood glucose levels checked
You'll be measuring your blood glucose yourself every day, to check your levels.
Your GP or diabetes care team will also carry out a different blood test every two to six months, called the HbA1c test.
This gives a clearer idea of how well your treatment plan is working, by measuring how stable your glucose levels have been over the past 6-12 weeks.
It measures the amount of haemoglobin, which is the oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells that has glucose attached to it. A high HbA1c level may indicate that your blood glucose level is consistently high and that your diabetes treatment plan needs to be altered.
The ideal HbA1c target for people with diabetes is below 48 mmol/mol.
The
Diabetes UKwebsite has more information about
blood glucose levels.
Treating hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)
Hypoglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose level becomes very low. It's likely that you'll develop hypoglycaemia from time to time.
Mild hypoglycaemia (or a "hypo") can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, and can be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary, such as a fizzy drink (not a diet version), sugar cubes or raisins. You may also be able to take pure glucose, in the form of a tablet or fluid, if you need to control the symptoms of a hypo quickly.
If you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you can become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. If this occurs, you'll need assistance from another person who may be able to give you a glucose gel rubbed into your cheeks or an injection of glucagon into your muscle. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.
Your diabetes care team may show several of your family members and close friends how to inject glucagon or give you glucose gel, should you need it.
Once you begin to come round, you'll need to eat something sugary when you're alert enough to do so. If you lose consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia, there's a risk that it could happen again within a few hours, so you'll need to rest afterwards and have someone with you.
If the glucagon injection into your muscle doesn't work, and you're still drowsy or unconscious 10 minutes after the injection, you'll need urgent medical attention.
You'll need to have another injection of glucagon straight into a vein, which must be given by a trained healthcare professional.
If you have type 1 diabetes, it's recommended that you carry identification with you so that people are aware of the problem if you become hypoglycaemic.
Islet cell transplantation
Some people with type 1 diabetes may benefit from a fairly new procedure known as islet cell transplantation. It involves implanting healthy islet cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes.
In 2008, a government-funded islet cell transplant programme was introduced, and the procedure is now available through the NHS for people who satisfy certain criteria (see below).
You may be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you've had:

two or more severe hypos within the last two years and you have a poor awareness of hypoglycaemia
a working kidney transplant, severe hypos and poor hypoglycaemia awareness, or poor blood glucose control even after receiving the best medical treatment
You may not be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you:

weigh over 85kg (13st 5.4lb)
have poor kidney function
need a lot of insulin – for example, over 50 units a day for a 70kg (11st) person
An islet cell transplant is a minor, low-risk procedure that's carried out under
local anaesthetic.
The procedure has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of severe hypos. So far, the results of islet cell transplants carried out in the UK have shown a significant reduction in the number of hypos, from 23 per person per year before transplantation to less than one per person per year afterwards.
The
Diabetes UK website has more information about
islet cell transplantsand
hypoglycaemia.
Pancreas transplant
People with type 1 diabetes who are having a kidney transplant from a donor may also be offered a pancreas transplant at the same time.
Others may be offered a pancreas transplant after they've had a kidney transplant because they’re already on anti-rejection tablets.
If you're having repeated, severe and life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks, a pancreas transplant may also be recommended.
During the procedure, your faulty pancreas will be replaced with a healthy pancreas from a donor. This will allow you to get a new source of insulin.
Pancreas transplants are complicated operations and, like other types of major surgery, there's a risk of complications. In the UK, about 200 pancreas transplants are carried out each year, with more than 300 people on the waiting list.
The waiting time for a pancreas transplant is one to two years, because there's a shortage of suitable donor organs.
Treating hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose)
Hyperglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose levels become too high. It can happen for several reasons, such as eating too much, being unwell or not taking enough insulin.
If you develop hyperglycaemia, you may need to adjust your diet or your insulin dose to keep your glucose levels normal. Your diabetes care team can advise you about the best way to do this.
If hyperglycaemia isn't treated, it can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of glucose, resulting in a build-up of ketones (acids) in your blood.
Diabetic ketoacidosis is very serious and, if not addressed quickly, it can lead to unconsciousness and, eventually, death.
The signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include:

frequently passing urine
thirst
tiredness and lethargy (lack of energy)
blurry vision
abdominal (stomach) pain
nausea and vomiting
deep breathing
smell of ketones on breath (described as smelling like pear drops)
collapse and unconsciousness
Read more about the
symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis
Your healthcare team will educate you on how to decrease your risk of ketoacidosis by testing your own blood for ketones using blood ketone sticks if you're unwell.
If you develop diabetic ketoacidosis, you'll need urgent hospital treatment. You'll be given insulin directly into a vein (intravenously). You may also need other fluids given by a drip if you're dehydrated, including salt solution and potassium.
Other treatments
Type 1 diabetes can lead to long-term complications. If you have the condition, you have an increased risk of developing
heart disease,
strokeand
kidney disease. To reduce the chance of this, you may be advised to take:

anti-hypertensive medicines to control
high blood pressure
a statin – such as simvastatin – to reduce
high cholesterol levels
low-dose aspirin to prevent stroke
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor – such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease
Diabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of a protein called albumin in your urine. It's often reversible if treated early enough.
Care standards for diabetes
The aim of treating diabetes is to help people with the condition control their blood glucose levels and minimise the risk of developing future complications.
The Department of Health has set out national standards for NHS organisations and professionals covering diabetes care and prevention.
The
Diabetes National Service Frameworkwas developed by diabetes clinical experts and patients with diabetes. Good diabetes care includes:

access to information and appropriate support for people with type 1 diabetes, including access to a structured education programme – such as
Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE)
an agreed care plan, helping all people with diabetes to manage their care and lead a healthy lifestyle – including a named contact for their care
information, care and support to enable all people with diabetes to control their blood glucose, maintain an acceptable blood pressure and minimise other risk factors for developing complications
access to services to identify and treat possible complications – such as screening for
diabetic retinopathy(where high blood glucose levels damage the retina at the back of the eye) and specialised foot care
effective care for all people with diabetes admitted to hospital, for whatever reason
The 
Diabetes UKwebsite has more information about
care from healthcare professionals.

Complications of type 1 diabetes

If diabetes isn't treated, it can lead to a number of different health problems. High glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.
Even a mildly raised glucose level that doesn't cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.
Heart disease and stroke
If you have diabetes, you're up to five times more likely to develop
heart disease or have a 
stroke.
Prolonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of developing
atherosclerosis (furring and narrowing of your blood vessels).
This may result in a poor blood supply to your heart, causing
angina (a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest). It also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become completely blocked, leading to a 
heart attackor
stroke.
Nerve damage
High blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels of your nerves. This can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. If the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoeaor
constipation.
Retinopathy
Retinopathy is where the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue) at the back of the eye is damaged. Blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. This prevents the light from fully passing through to your retina. If it isn't treated, it can damage your vision.
The better you control your blood sugar levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems. Having an annual eye check with a specialist (an ophthalmologist or optometrist) can help pick up signs of a potentially serious eye problem early so that it can be treated. 
Read about
diabetic eye screening.
If it's caught early enough, diabetic retinopathy can be managed using laser treatment. However, this will only preserve the sight you have, rather than make it better.
Kidney disease
If the small blood vessels in your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently.
In rare, severe cases, this can lead to
kidney failure and the need for
dialysis(treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys). In some cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary.
Foot problems
Damage to the nerves of the foot can mean that small nicks and cuts aren't noticed, which can lead to a foot ulcer developing. About 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause serious infection.
If you develop nerve damage, you should check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist. Look out for sores and cuts that don't heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. You should also have a foot examination at least once a year.
Read more about
foot care and diabetes.
Sexual dysfunction
In men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to
erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication.
Women with diabetes may experience:

a reduced sex drive (
loss of libido)
reduced pleasure from sex
vaginal dryness
a reduced ability to orgasm
pain during sex
If you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication, or you find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.
Miscarriage and stillbirth
Pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of 
miscarriageand
stillbirth. If your blood sugar level isn't carefully controlled immediately before and during early pregnancy, there's also an increased risk of the baby developing a serious birth defect.
Pregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetes clinic. This allows doctors to keep a close eye on their blood sugar levels and control their insulin dosage more easily.
The
Diabetes UKwebsite has more information about
diabetes complications.

Living with type 1 diabetes

Look after your feet
Having diabetes means that you're more likely to develop problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes. This is because blood glucose can damage the nerves in your feet.
To prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water. Wear shoes that fit properly and see a podiatrist or chiropodist (a foot care specialist) regularly so that any problems are detected early.
Regularly check your feet for cuts, 
blistersor grazes because you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged. See your GP if you have a minor foot injury that doesn't start to heal within a few days.
The
Diabetes UKwebsite has more information and advice about
taking care of your feet.
Regular eye tests
If you have type 1 diabetes, you should be invited to have your your eyes screened at once a year to check for
diabetic retinopathy.
Retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged. It can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long time (hyperglycaemia). If it isn't treated, retinopathy can eventually cause sight loss.
Read more about
diabetic eye screening.
Pregnancy
If you have diabetes and you're thinking about having a baby, it's a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team.
A planned pregnancy enables you to make sure your blood sugar levels are as well controlled as possible before you get pregnant.
You'll need to keep your blood sugar under tight control, particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, to reduce the risk of the baby developing serious birth defects.
You should also take a higher dose of 
folic acidtablets. Folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems. Doctors now recommend that all women planning to have a baby take folic acid. Women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg a day until they're 12 weeks pregnant (only available on prescription).
You should also have your eyes checked. Retinopathy (see above) affects the blood vessels in the eyes and is a risk for all people with diabetes. Pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, so it's important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant.
Your GP or diabetes care team can give you further advice. 
Diabetes UKalso provides more useful information about
pregnancy and diabetes to help you get your pregnancy off to a healthy start.
Education
You'll be best equipped to manage your diabetes if you're given information and education when you're diagnosed, and then on an ongoing basis.
The 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)strongly recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves.
This gives people the best chance of developing the skills they need to effectively treat their condition, maintain their glucose levels at a normal level and help prevent long-term complications. It also reduces the risk of developing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels).
Structured patient education
Structured patient education means there's a planned course that:

covers all aspects of diabetes
is flexible in content
is relevant to a person’s clinical and psychological needs
is adaptable to a person’s educational and cultural background
For type 1 diabetes, there's a national patient education programme called
Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating (DAFNE).
DAFNE is a skills-based course where people with type 1 diabetes learn how to adjust their insulin dose to suit what they eat, rather than having to eat to match their insulin doses.
There are also several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education. Ask your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide.
Diabetes and your child
For a parent whose child is diagnosed with a life-long condition, the job of parenting becomes even tougher.
Although being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes will involve coming to terms with the diagnosis, getting used to treatment and making changes to everyday life, your child can still lead a normal and healthy life.
Below is some useful advice from 
Diabetes UKfor parents of children with diabetes:

Get the knowledge – make sure you understand what diabetes is, what blood glucose targets are and what your child should aim for, and how insulin or insulin pumps work. Don’t be afraid to ask your care team questions. No question is a silly question, and it’s more than likely they’ve heard it before. Ask your care team for relevant leaflets about diabetes that you can take away.
Get the skills: make sure you're confident about the practical aspects of your child’s care. Know how to inject or manage a pump, monitor blood glucose, treat hypos, provide a healthy, balanced diet and know how illnesses, such as
coldsor
childhood fever, can affect your child’s blood glucose levels. 
Know what care to expect: your child has the right to be treated by a specialist paediatric diabetes team, not just in a general paediatric clinic. You should also have access to a paediatric diabetes specialist nurse (PDSN). Ask for the contact numbers of your care team in case of an emergency.
Get emotional support and start talking: feelings of
depression, guilt or anger are normal, so talk to your healthcare team or ask to see a psychologist for you or your child. Ask to meet another family or go on a Diabetes UK family support weekend. Meeting other families and knowing that you’re not alone always helps. 
Work with your child’s school and teachers: agree on a healthcare plan for your child with the school and your PDSN. This should cover who gives injections and monitors blood glucose and when and whether a private area is available if your child isn't comfortable injecting in front of their classmates. Other things to consider include sharps disposal, sweet snacks in case of hypos, PE and other sporting activities. School is a big part of a child’s life so take the time to ensure your child's head teacher, teachers and classmates are educated and involved. 
Make sure life goes on: allow yourself and your child to experience normal daily routines. If your child used to spend afternoons or sleepovers at friends’ houses, ensure that this still happens. You can't be with your child 24 hours a day, so share responsibility and allow your family and friends to help. If you have other children, make sure they get your attention too. Don’t rule out sweets completely. Diabetes means low sugar, not no sugar.
The
Diabetes UKwebsite has more information and advice about
your child and diabetes.
Help and support
Many people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from a group for people with diabetes.
Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet others who've been diagnosed with the condition.
The 
Diabetes UKwebsite enables you to 
find your local diabetes support group. If you want to contact a trained counsellor directly, you can phone Diabetes UK’s care line on 0345 123 2399, or email
careline@diabetes.org.uk.
The
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF)also holds regular local events.
Financial support and benefits
If your diabetes is controlled by medication, you're entitled to free prescriptions and eye examinations.
Some people with diabetes may be eligible to receive disability benefits and incapacity benefits, depending on the impact the condition has on their life.
The main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, elderly people, people with learning disabilities or mental health problems, and those with
complications of diabetes.
People over 65 who are severely disabled, may qualify for a type of disability benefit called
Attendance Allowance.
Carers may also be entitled to some benefit too, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes.
Staff at your local 
Citizen’s Advice Bureau (CAB)can check whether you're getting all of the benefits you're entitled to. Both they and your diabetes specialist nurse should also be able to give you advice about filling in the forms.
GOV.UK has more information about 
benefits, and the
Diabetes UKwebsite has further advice about the 
Disability Living Allowance (DLA).
