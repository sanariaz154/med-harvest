 Sample Name: Abnormal Stress Test Description: Patient had a markedly abnormal stress test with severe chest pain after 5 minutes of exercise on the standard Bruce with horizontal ST depressions and moderate apical ischemia on stress imaging only.
 (Medical Transcription Sample Report)
 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. ABC is a 60-year-old gentleman who had a markedly abnormal stress test earlier today in my office with severe chest pain after 5 minutes of exercise on the standard Bruce with horizontal ST depressions and moderate apical ischemia on stress imaging only.  He required 3 sublingual nitroglycerin in total (please see also admission history and physical for full details).
 The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with myself today which showed mild-to-moderate left main distal disease of 30%, moderate proximal LAD with a severe mid-LAD lesion of 99%, and a mid-left circumflex lesion of 80% with normal LV function and some mild luminal irregularities in the right coronary artery with some moderate stenosis seen in the mid to distal right PDA.
 I discussed these results with the patient, and he had been relating to me that he was having rest anginal symptoms, as well as nocturnal anginal symptoms, and especially given the severity of the mid left anterior descending lesion, with a markedly abnormal stress test, I felt he was best suited for transfer for PCI.  I discussed the case with Dr. X at Medical Center who has kindly accepted the patient in transfer.
 CONDITION ON TRANSFER: Stable but guarded.  The patient is pain-free at this time.
 MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: 1.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
 2.  Metoprolol 50 mg once a day, but we have had to hold it because of relative bradycardia which he apparently has a history of.
 3.  Nexium 40 mg once a day.
 4.  Zocor 40 mg once a day, and there is a fasting lipid profile pending at the time of this dictation.  I see that his LDL was 136 on May 3, 2002.
 5.  Plavix 600 mg p.o. x1 which I am giving him tonight.
 Other medical history is inclusive for obstructive sleep apnea for which he is unable to tolerate positive pressure ventilation, GERD, arthritis
 DISPOSITION: The patient and his wife have requested and are agreeable with transfer to Medical Center, and we are enclosing the CD ROM of his images.

 Sample Name: Consult - Smoking Cessation Description: The patient needs refills on her Xanax
 (Medical Transcription Sample Report)
 CHIEF COMPLAINT: I need refills.
 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today stating that she needs refills on her Xanax, and she would also like to get something to help her quit smoking.  She is a new patient today.  She states that she has mesothelioma in the lining of her stomach and that it does cause her some problems with eating and it causes some chronic pain.  She states that she is under the care of a cancer specialist; however, she just recently moved back to this area and is trying to find a doctor a little closer than his office.  She states that she has tried several different things to help her quit smoking and she has failed everything and had heard good results about Chantix and wanted to give it a try.
 OBJECTIVE: Well developed and well nourished.  She does not appear to be in any acute distress.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm.  No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Capillary refill less than 3 seconds.  Peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally.  Respiratory:  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with good effort.  No tenderness to palpation over chest wall.  Musculoskeletal:  She has full range of motion of all four extremities.  No tenderness to palpation over long bones.  Skin:  Warm and dry.  No rashes or lesions.  Neuro:  Alert and oriented x3.  Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact.  No focal deficits.
 PLAN: I did refill her medications.  I have requested that she have her primary doctor forward her records to me.  I have discussed Chantix and its use and success rate.  She was given a prescription, as well as a coupon.  She is to watch for any worsening signs or symptoms.  She verbalized understanding of discharge instructions and prescriptions.  I would like to see her back to proceed with her preventive health measures.

 Sample Name: Gen Med Office Note - 1 Description: Patient has a past history of known hyperthyroidism and a recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%.
 (Medical Transcription Sample Report)
 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 43-year-old male who was recently discharged from our care on the 1/13/06 when he presented for shortness of breath. He has a past history of known hyperthyroidism since 1992 and a more recent history of atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 20%-25%. The main cause for his shortness of breath was believed to be due to atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism in a setting with congestive cardiac failure. During his hospital stay, he was commenced on metoprolol for rate control, and given that he had atrial fibrillation, he was also started on warfarin, which his INR has been followed up by the Homeless Clinic. For his congestive cardiac failure, he was restarted on Digoxin and lisinopril. For his hyperthyroidism, we restarted him on PTU and the endocrinologists were happy to review him when he was euthymic to discuss further radioiodine or radiotherapy. He was restarted on PTU and discharged from the hospital on this medication. While in the hospital, it was also noted that he abused cigarettes and cocaine, and we advised strongly against this given the condition of his heart. It was also noted that he had elevated liver function tests, which an ultrasound was normal, but his hepatitis panel was pending. Since his discharge, his hepatitis panel has come back normal for hepatitis A, B, and C. Since discharge, the patient has complained of shortness of breath, mainly at night when lying flat, but otherwise he states he has been well and compliant with his medication.
 MEDICATIONS: Digoxin 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 5 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, PTU (propylthiouracil) 300 mg orally four times a day, warfarin variable dose based on INR.
 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: He was afebrile today. Blood pressure 114/98. Pulse 92 but irregular. Respiratory rate 25.
 HEENT: Obvious exophthalmus, but no obvious lid lag today.
 NECK: There was no thyroid mass palpable.
 CHEST: Clear except for occasional bibasilar crackles.
 CARDIOVASCULAR: Heart sounds were dual, but irregular, with no additional sounds.
 ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended.
 EXTREMITIES: Mild +1 peripheral edema in both legs.
 PLAN: The patient has also been attending the Homeless Clinic since discharge from the hospital, where he has been receiving quality care and they have been looking after every aspect of his health, including his hyperthyroidism. It is our recommendation that a TSH and T4 be continually checked until the patient is euthymic, at which time he should attend endocrine review with Dr. Huffman for further treatment of his hyperthyroidism. Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he is moderately rate controlled with metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d. His rate in clinic today was 92. He could benefit from increasing his metoprolol dose, however, in the hospital it was noted that he was bradycardic in the morning with a pulse rate down to the 50s, and we were concerned with making this patient bradycardic in the setting of congestive cardiac failure. Regarding his congestive cardiac failure, he currently appears stable, with some variation in his weight. He states he has been taking his wife's Lasix tablets for diuretic benefit when he feels weight gain coming on and increased edema. We should consider adding him on a low-dose furosemide tablet to be taken either daily or when his weight is above his target range. A Digoxin level has not been repeated since discharge, and we feel that this should be followed up. We have also increased his lisinopril to 5 mg daily, but the patient did not receive his script upon departing our clinic. Regarding his elevated liver function tests, we feel that these are very likely secondary to hepatic congestion secondary to congestive cardiac failure with a normal ultrasound and normal hepatitis panel, but yet the liver function tests should be followed up.

 Sample Name: Headache - Office Visit Description: The patient with continued problems with her headaches.
 (Medical Transcription Sample Report)
 The patient returns to our office today because of continued problems with her headaches.  She was started on Zonegran on her last visit and she states that initially she titrated upto 100 mg q.h.s.  Initially felt that the Zonegran helped, but then the pain in her head returned.  It is an area of tenderness and sensitivity in her left parietal area.  It is a very localized pain.  She takes Motrin 400 mg b.i.d., which helped.
 She also had EMG/nerve conduction studies since she was last seen in our office that showed severe left ulnar neuropathy, moderate right ulnar neuropathy, bilateral mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel and diabetic neuropathy.  She was referred to Dr. XYZ and will be seeing him on August 8, 2006.
 She was also never referred to the endocrine clinic to deal with her poor diabetes control.  Her last hemoglobin A1c was 10.
 PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids, status post CVA, and diabetic retinopathy.
 MEDICATIONS: Glyburide, Avandia, metformin, lisinopril, Lipitor, aspirin, metoprolol and Zonegran.
 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure was 140/70, heart rate was 76, respiratory rate was 18, and weight was 226 pounds.  On general exam she has an area of tenderness on palpation in the left parietal region of her scalp.  Neurological exam is detailed on our H&amp;P form.  Her neurological exam is within normal limits.
 IMPRESSION AND PLAN: For her headaches we are going to titrate Zonegran up to 200 mg q.h.s. to try to maximize the Zonegran therapy.  If this is not effective, when she comes back on August 7, 2006 we will then consider other anticonvulsants such as Neurontin or Lyrica.  We also discussed with Ms. Hawkins the possibility of nerve block injection; however, at this point she is not interested.
 She will be seeing Dr. XYZ for her neuropathies.
 We made an appointment in endocrine clinic today for a counseling in terms of better diabetes control and she is responsible for trying to get her referral from her primary care physician to go for this consult.

 Sample Name: Hip Pain Description: Persistent left hip pain.  Left hip avascular necrosis.  Discussed the possibility of hip arthrodesis versus hip replacement versus hip resurfacing
 (Medical Transcription Sample Report)
 CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left hip pain.
 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 32-year-old male seen by Dr. ABC several weeks ago for persistent left hip pain.  He has a long eight to ten year history of pain into the left hip.  He has been worked up by several specialists and evaluated.  He was thought initially to have low back pain with radiculopathy.  He does have a history of antibiotic steroid use as well as heavy drinking.  He reports his symptoms started approximately eight years ago when he was doing some construction at which time he began to have left hip pain.  He has had difficulties on and off ever since then.  On the last visit, radiographs revealed severe degenerative changes of the left hip joint with apparent AVN of the left femoral head.  He was given some pain medication and discussion took place regarding referring him to a specialist for evaluation of possible hip resurfacing versus conventional total hip replacement.  He came for a second opinion in the area and we discussed his problems further.  He continues to have primarily groin pain, which limits his daily activities.  He has used a cane in the past for a short period and he continues to have difficulty with the left hip.
 PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes and high blood pressure.
 PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He had a history of surgery for an undescended testicle.
 MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Prozac, lisinopril, Norco, and glimepiride.
 ALLERGIES: No know drug allergies.
 SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient current smokes.
 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals significant limited internal rotation of the left hip.  He essentially has 0 degrees of internal rotation compared to the contralateral hip, which has approximately 30 degrees.  He has significant pain with hip range of motion.  There is no significant leg length discrepancy.  He has no numbness or tingling distal and 2+ pulses.
 X-RAYS: Review of films taken previously reveals severe degenerative changes consistent with AVN.
 ASSESSMENT: Left hip avascular necrosis.
 PLAN: I had a long discussion with the patient regarding his problem and he voiced understanding.  We discussed the possibility of hip arthrodesis versus hip replacement versus hip resurfacing and the high likelihood that any one of these procedures may require further operations throughout his life secondary to his young age and high activity level.  We discussed a referral to a hip specialist, who performs resurfacing procedures specifically Dr. XYZ in Houston.  Referral will be arranged for him.  All questions were answered to his satisfaction.  He was also given a prescription of Norco 10/325, #60 and Flexeril until he is able to arrange an appointment with a hip specialist.

 PROCEDURE: Induction of vaginal delivery of viable male, Apgars 8 and 9.
 HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 20-year-old female, gravida 4, para 0, who presented to the office.  She had small amount of leaking since last night.  On exam, she was positive Nitrazine, no ferning was noted.  On ultrasound, her AFI was about 4.7 cm.  Because of a variable cervix, oligohydramnios, and possible ruptured membranes, we recommended induction.
 She was brought to the hospital and begun on Pitocin.  Once she was in her regular pattern, we ruptured her bag of water; fluid was clear.  She went rapidly to completion over the next hour and a half.  She then pushed for 2 hours delivering a viable male over an intact perineum in an OA presentation.  Upon delivery of the head, the anterior and posterior arms were delivered, and remainder of the baby without complications.  The baby was vigorous, moving all extremities.  The cord was clamped and cut.  The baby was handed off to mom with nurse present.  Apgars were 8 and 9.  Placenta was delivered spontaneously, intact.  Three-vessel cord with no retained placenta.  Estimated blood loss was about 150 mL.  There were no tears.
